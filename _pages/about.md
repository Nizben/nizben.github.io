Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I am Nizar, a PhD student at <a href='https://www.polytechnique.edu'>École Polytechnique</a>, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://triocrossing.github.io'>Xi Wang</a> and Prof. <a href='https://boukhayma.github.io'>Adnane Boukhayma</a>. I am part of the <a href='https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/'>VISTA</a> team at <a href='https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/'>LIX</a>.
I am interested in world models, video diffusion models, controllable generation, ...

Before that, I was a research engineer at <a href='https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr'>MAP5</a>, working on the <a href='https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/index.html'>KeOps</a> library with the library's authors <a href='https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~glaunes/'>Joan Glaunès</a>, <a href='https://www.jeanfeydy.com'>Jean Feydy</a>, and <a href='https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/'>Benjamin Charlier</a>.

I had also the opportunity to spend some time as a research engineer at <a href='https://list.cea.fr/en/'>CEA-List</a>, a public french lab, where I worked on audio data representation learning, audio domain adaptation, and also some cool applications around embedding quantized models for real-time inference on edge devices.

I earned my master’s degree at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">IMT Atlantique</a> (ex-Télécom Bretagne) in 2022 with a specialization in machine learning and computational mathematics.

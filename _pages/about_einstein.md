Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am Nizar Benbouchta, a research engineer at the <a href='https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr'>MAP5</a> lab, which is a part of the <a href='https://u-paris.fr/en/'>UniversitÃ© Paris-CitÃ©</a>.

I am currently working on the <a href='https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/index.html'>KeOps</a> library. The KeOps library lets you compute reductions of large arrays whose entries are given by a mathematical formula or a neural network. It combines efficient C++ routines with an automatic differentiation engine and can be used with Python (NumPy, PyTorch), Matlab and R.

Previously, I earned my masterâ€™s degree at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">IMT Atlantique</a> (ex-TÃ©lÃ©com Bretagne) in 2022 with a specialization in machine learning and computational mathematics.
